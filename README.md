**Goal:**
The objective of this project was to analyze and visualize the last three months of booking details for a hotel chain operating in various cities to find the reason for **decrease in their bookings**. The goal was to derive actionable insights and present them through a Power BI dashboard, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to improve hotel performance and customer satisfaction.

**Steps Undertaken:**

Data Collection and Understanding:
1. Obtained the dataset containing booking details for the last three months, including various key metrics.
2. Familiarized with the dataset to understand the structure and the relevance of each metric.

Data Cleaning and Transformation:
1. Cleaned the dataset to handle missing values and ensure data consistency.
2. Transformed data to derive new metrics and ensure the dataset was suitable for analysis.

Data Modelling:
1. Created relationships between different tables in Power BI to enable seamless data analysis.
2. Established calculated columns and measures to enhance data analysis and visualization.

**Defining Key Metrics:**

1. ADR (Average Daily Rate): Average revenue earned per occupied room.
2. RevPar (Revenue per Available Room): Total room revenue divided by the number of available rooms.
3. Revenue: Total revenue generated from bookings.
4. Occupancy%: Percentage of occupied rooms.
5. DSRN (Daily Sales Room Nights): Number of rooms sold per day.
6. DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights): Number of rooms booked per day.
7. DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights): Number of rooms utilized per day.
8. Realisation: Revenue realization percentage.
9. Cancellation: Rate of booking cancellations.
    
**Visualization and Dashboard Creation:**

1. Developed various visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to represent key metrics.
2. Created interactive filters and slicers to enable dynamic data exploration.
3. Designed a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing dashboard layout to ensure ease of use and clarity of insights.
   
**Insight Derivation:**

1. Analyzed the visualizations to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in the booking data.
2. Provided insights on performance across different cities, peak booking periods, and the impact of cancellations.
3. Highlighted key areas of improvement and potential strategies for revenue optimization.
   
**Outcome:**

The Power BI dashboard effectively presents the key performance metrics and insights, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions to enhance hotel operations and customer satisfaction. The project showcases advanced data analysis and visualization skills, demonstrating the ability to transform raw data into meaningful business intelligence.
